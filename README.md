## An Interactive Introduction to Unsupervised Learning

You've probably been introduced to supervised learning techniques, where you try to predict a numeric, binary, or categorical target variable from numerous features. But what if you don't have a target? What if you're trying to reduce the dimensionality of your data, find similar observations, or identify patterns from many parameters? Unsupervised learning may be less widely understood in the oil and gas industry than its supervised partner, but it can be incredibly useful. This session provides a hands on introduction to some of the most popular unsupervised learning techniques, with a focus on demystifying some of the terminology and providing a simple, intuitive understanding of the fundamental concepts in unsupervised learning. 

The agenda for the 2020-01-21 session includes:

1. The concept of similarity and distance, introduced through k-nearest neighbors - an illustrative supervised technique.

2. A short exercise to reduce the dimensionality of a stack of geology maps and well completion parameters using principal component analysis, trying to demystify some jargon in the process.

3. A rough introduction to the k-means clustering algorithm and measures of clustering 'goodness' using well completion parameters.

4. A short introduction to hierarchical clustering from a lumberjack's perspective using the same data.

Each section is ran in a separate Jupyter notebook. These are designed to work with minimal dependencies on a windows/mac operating system with the Anaconda distribution. To keep things simple we've limited the packages to Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn. 

Before the workshop please make sure that:

- You have a working [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) and can launch [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
- You can access this repository from [The Github repository](https://github.com/ScottHMcKean/untapped_energy_clustering), either through cloning it to your hard drive, or downloading it as a .zip file
- Can import the libraries in the test notebook (test.jpynb)
