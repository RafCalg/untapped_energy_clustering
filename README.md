# Untapped Energy Clustering Workshop

This repository contains the notebooks for the Untapped Energy meetup on January 21, 2020. The workshop is designed to work with minimal dependencies on a windows/mac operating system with the Anaconda distribution. To keep things simple I've tried to limit the packages we use to Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn. Before the workshop please make sure that:

1) You have a working Anaconda distribution and can launch Jupyter notebook
2) You can access this repository, either through cloning it to your hard drive, or downloading it as a .zip file
3) Can import the libraries in the test notebook (test.jpynb)
